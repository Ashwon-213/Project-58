    <h1>About</h1>
    <p> My hobby is playing videogames. After finishing my homework for the day I go down to my basement and start playing videogames. Videogames can make you new friends and are really interactive.Playing video games directly affects and impacts regions of the brain responsible for memory, spatial orientation, information organizations, and fine motor skills. The study also reinforces the claim that, like exercise, playing games for as little as 30 minutes a day, can improve your life This is why I play videogames.</p>
